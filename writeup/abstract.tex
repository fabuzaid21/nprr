	Efficient join processing is one of the most fundamental and well-studied tasks in database research. A worst-case optimal join algorithm was established by Ngo, Porat, R$\acute{e}$ and Rudra. However, they left an interesting question: What's the performance of the algorithm for average case complexity? In this work, we implemented these ideas to see how they compare to the algorithms in a modern RDBMS and describe a detailed implementation and possible integration on PostgreSQL and Spark. Experiments on real world graphs verified that NPRR is able to achieve 2-6 times performance improvements over the state-of-the-art RDBMS.
