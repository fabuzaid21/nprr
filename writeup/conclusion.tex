\section{Conclusion}


As many large scale data analytics engines emerge such as Spark and F1, queries are becoming more and more complex. However, the performance of evaluating a join query using a pair-wise manner could be highly suboptimal. In this paper, we studied a worst-case optimal join algorithm was established by Ngo, Porat, R$\acute{e}$ and Rudra. We implemented these ideas to see how they compare to the algorithms in a modern RDBMS and describe a detailed implementation and possible integration on PostgreSQL and Spark. Experiments on real world graphs verified that NPRR is able to achieve 2-6 times performance improvements over the state-of-the-art RDBMS.
